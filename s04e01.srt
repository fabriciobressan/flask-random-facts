1
00:00:57,351 --> 00:00:58,602
This is Brock.

2
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:01,772
There's an old hunting cabin up here.
I'm gonna go check it out.

3
00:01:01,855 --> 00:01:02,982
Woman: Copy.

4
00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:05,943
Do you want to wait for backup?

5
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:07,987
Negative. Looks abandoned.

6
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:23,604
Holy shit.

7
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,525
Hood.

8
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,784
How'd you find me?

9
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,204
I didn't.

10
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:06,275
I mean, I wasn't looking for you.

11
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,668
I thought you were gone.

12
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:14,506
Hey, you want to do me a favor
and point that thing somewhere else, okay?

13
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:24,683
Holy hell.

14
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:31,773
Haven't seen you in two years.

15
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,109
And all that time you've been

16
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:38,322
living up in this cabin like some kind of
mountain man or something?

17
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:44,620
Is anybody here with you?

18
00:04:48,957 --> 00:04:50,557
Then I'm gonna need you to come with me.

19
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,922
I'm not asking.

20
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:00,469
Sheriff lotus.

21
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:01,678
That's right.

22
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,352
How does that feel?

23
00:05:08,435 --> 00:05:09,978
Like a hemorrhoid.

24
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,913
You want to tell me what this is about?

25
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:31,483
I'll tell you down at the station.

26
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,961
You mean the cadi?

27
00:05:36,296 --> 00:05:37,506
No, I don't.

28
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:06,076
What do you think?

29
00:06:06,535 --> 00:06:08,287
Bulletproof glass.

30
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,497
One-and-a-half-inch-thick polycarb.

31
00:06:11,999 --> 00:06:13,292
Thought you'd like that.

32
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:18,481
Scott, I need those fingerprint results
as soon as you get them.

33
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:19,840
- Sure.
- Thanks.

34
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:28,026
I need to know about the press conference.

35
00:06:29,725 --> 00:06:32,978
Bunker, you remember Mr. Hood?

36
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:34,730
Deputy Nina Cruz.

37
00:06:37,774 --> 00:06:40,861
Billy raven moved on.
He's the new chief of the kinaho pd.

38
00:06:40,944 --> 00:06:41,945
Woman: Sheriff.

39
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:44,489
Brock: Helen, any messages?
Woman: On your desk.

40
00:06:44,573 --> 00:06:46,700
- Oh, the FBI?
- Woman: Not yet.

41
00:07:00,172 --> 00:07:01,465
Nice office.

42
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:03,800
Yes, it is. Can I get
you something to drink?

43
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:05,218
I got water, coffee.

44
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:07,512
I've got this Espresso machine here.

45
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:11,892
Have a seat.

46
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:20,766
First of all, you should know,

47
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:22,648
when I went up there today,

48
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:26,406
you were the last
person I expected to find.

49
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,164
Were you in that cabin two nights ago?

50
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,668
Yes.

51
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,961
- Anybody with you?
- No.

52
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:41,171
Who's dead?

53
00:07:56,436 --> 00:07:57,604
Who is that?

54
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,158
Rebecca.

55
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:12,994
Brock: Her body was found yesterday,
near the river.

56
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,882
That's not where she was killed,
but that's where the body was dumped.

57
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:21,294
Jesus.

58
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,257
Brock: This is the third murder of its kind
that we've had this year.

59
00:08:28,135 --> 00:08:30,554
- You call the FBI?
- Yeah.

60
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:32,347
I called them after the second one.

61
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:33,533
And they sent some little shit up here,

62
00:08:33,557 --> 00:08:35,284
and he looked through our files
and took some notes,

63
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:39,229
and then he ran back to Quantico as fast
as his little $60 loafers could take him.

64
00:08:39,312 --> 00:08:42,107
Told me to call back if
a third body turned up.

65
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,817
So maybe now they'll give a shit.

66
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:47,673
So, what does this have to do with me?

67
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:51,366
When was the last time you saw Rebecca?

68
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,993
I haven't seen anyone

69
00:08:54,453 --> 00:08:56,121
for about 18 months.

70
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,665
You know, and yet, it's the weird part,

71
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:01,001
the last coordinates on her car's GPS

72
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:03,545
brought me up to your cabin today.

73
00:09:06,256 --> 00:09:08,508
- You didn't see her?
- Nope.

74
00:09:08,592 --> 00:09:10,192
Any idea why she'd come looking for you?

75
00:09:10,761 --> 00:09:12,905
You know, how the hell she even know
you were up there, hood?

76
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,365
I'm just trying to put this together.

77
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,308
- It's her uncle's land.
- It's what?

78
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:18,810
It's her uncle's land.

79
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:20,997
You're living on proctor's land?

80
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:22,647
He doesn't know.

81
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:25,192
What happened to you, hood?

82
00:09:26,985 --> 00:09:28,320
I retired.

83
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:33,909
We found trace blood
that didn't match Rebecca's.

84
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:36,578
I'm gonna need you to, uh,

85
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,206
voluntarily submit a blood sample
so we can rule you out.

86
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:41,142
What, do you think
I'm a fucking serial killer, now?

87
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,667
Have you seen yourself lately, hood?

88
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,212
You're living up in the woods.
You look like the unabomber.

89
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:46,379
Yes, you can have my blood.

90
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:47,631
Oh, and, hood,

91
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,994
if there's anything else you
want to tell me, now's the time.

92
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:57,808
You should be looking at proctor.

93
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:00,727
Brock: Yeah, well, these days
that's a little more complicated.

94
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,895
He's...

95
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,439
Yeah?

96
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,251
- Press conference is about to start.
- Oh, shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,402
- Okay.
- Sheriff hood.

98
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:10,737
He's not the sheriff.

99
00:10:12,322 --> 00:10:16,159
Listen, I'll have deputy Cruz
come up and take your blood,

100
00:10:16,243 --> 00:10:18,703
and then she'll give you a lift back.

101
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:21,581
Take care of yourself.

102
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:33,218
Lucas: And you are?

103
00:10:47,232 --> 00:10:48,525
Is there something wrong?

104
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:50,610
Sorry, you just, uh...

105
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,865
You reminded me of someone for a moment.

106
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:55,949
Mmm.

107
00:10:56,616 --> 00:11:00,078
Deputy who got killed.
Indian gangbanger broke her neck?

108
00:11:01,872 --> 00:11:04,165
I think I like you better
when you don't talk.

109
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:17,304
Sir.

110
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:19,264
Sir.

111
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:22,475
It's time.

112
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,934
Reporter 1: Mr. Mayor, this is the third
murder of a young woman this year.

113
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:48,102
Is this a serial killer and...

114
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:50,313
Reporter 2: Is it true
that the latest victim was your niece?

115
00:11:50,337 --> 00:11:52,897
Reporter 3: Mr. Mayor, why are
the police reports being withheld?

116
00:11:54,007 --> 00:11:57,052
Kai: Here's... here's what we know.
Here's what we know.

117
00:11:57,135 --> 00:11:59,262
Yesterday, the body of Rebecca bowman

118
00:11:59,346 --> 00:12:02,057
was found near the mouth
of the dellwood basin.

119
00:12:02,849 --> 00:12:04,100
She was murdered.

120
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:06,495
And while the police can't say for certain,

121
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,272
there are definitely similarities
between this case

122
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:12,943
and the murders of two other young women
that occurred over the last year.

123
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:16,947
The banshee Sheriff Department
has notified the FBI,

124
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:20,825
and agents are en route
to assist in the investigation.

125
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:28,625
And to answer your question,
yes, Rebecca was my niece.

126
00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:32,253
And, yes, you can rest
assured that neither I

127
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:35,715
nor sheriff lotus and the members
of his department will rest

128
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,302
until we have found
this sick, twisted bastard.

129
00:13:58,423 --> 00:13:59,799
Rebecca: So, this is it?

130
00:14:00,675 --> 00:14:01,968
Kai: Yes, this is it.

131
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:04,137
Rebecca: It's beautiful.

132
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,807
Kai: I'm going to be mayor,

133
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,061
and you're taking on more
of a leadership role in the business.

134
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,313
I just figured we 'd need something
a bit more secure.

135
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:18,318
Do you like it?

136
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:22,989
I love it.

137
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,043
Get out.

138
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,170
What's going on?

139
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:40,298
Da dismissed the
charges. You're free to go.

140
00:14:41,341 --> 00:14:42,383
You're fucking with us.

141
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:46,012
You got 10 seconds
before I close that door again.

142
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,016
I knew that arrest was bullshit.

143
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:03,404
- What was it this time?
- Physical evidence.

144
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,740
They practically strangled that old man.

145
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:08,576
I know. Da's a real piece of work.

146
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,161
He's a puppet.

147
00:15:10,245 --> 00:15:11,605
Proctor's got his hand up his ass.

148
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,878
But that's a talk for another time.

149
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:20,797
The walls have ears.

150
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,684
Hey, thanks a lot, officers.
Have a nice evening.

151
00:15:32,767 --> 00:15:35,812
Carrie: There's always some part of me
that's thinking about him.

152
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:40,567
How he looked when he died.

153
00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:43,903
How he looked at me.

154
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:55,290
Carrie: There are days when that look
haunts me so badly I can barely breathe.

155
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:57,584
Man: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look at this.

156
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:01,629
Carrie: And then there are days
when I can distract myself.

157
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,840
You lost, honey?

158
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:05,884
Carrie: Where / can shut off all the noise.

159
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,386
Maybe we can help you find your way.

160
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:09,888
Oh, I hope so.

161
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,516
Carrie: And just do what I have to do.

162
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,437
Those are the good days.

163
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:38,601
Carrie: So, you tough guys
like beating up on people, huh?

164
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,585
It wasn't us. They let us go.

165
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,420
Well, they shouldn't have.

166
00:16:50,261 --> 00:16:52,513
Carrie: There's always that moment
when I just wake up

167
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,807
where I think I'm still there.

168
00:16:56,434 --> 00:16:58,311
Still back there in our old house.

169
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:03,441
And when I roll over,
Gordon will be there lying next to me.

170
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:09,906
And then I'll hear the kids
stirring in their rooms.

171
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,492
Hubbard: So, how do you handle it?

172
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:13,826
Carrie: / exercise.

173
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,079
I eat something.

174
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,414
I start working on the house.

175
00:17:18,498 --> 00:17:20,250
Hubbard: How's the house coming along?

176
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:24,128
Carrie: There's something about working
with my hands that gives me peace.

177
00:17:25,546 --> 00:17:27,340
Hubbard: What else gives you peace?

178
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,176
Carrie: Not much.

179
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,762
Do you find our sessions helpful?

180
00:17:34,931 --> 00:17:37,100
I'm here because it's court-mandated.

181
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:39,102
No offense.

182
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:40,937
None taken.

183
00:17:43,106 --> 00:17:46,651
If I vouch for your competency
to parent your children, today,

184
00:17:47,694 --> 00:17:48,695
would you come back?

185
00:17:49,612 --> 00:17:51,656
If I said yes, would you do that?

186
00:17:51,739 --> 00:17:52,979
That's not really how it works.

187
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,121
They had no right to take my kids away.

188
00:17:58,705 --> 00:18:01,457
- You violated the terms of your probation.
- I was abducted.

189
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,419
The military investigation cleared us.

190
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:08,089
Any association with the criminal element
was enough for social services...

191
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:09,340
I know.

192
00:18:15,722 --> 00:18:16,723
I know.

193
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:53,718
How many times
are you gonna ruin our lives?

194
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,564
From now on, you're just the asshole
who knocked up my mom.

195
00:19:38,304 --> 00:19:39,430
Please.

196
00:20:24,851 --> 00:20:25,893
What are you doing here?

197
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:30,648
The manager told me
our former sheriff was on a bender.

198
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:33,609
Trashing the room.

199
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:37,822
Playing with guns.

200
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,784
How is that your business?

201
00:20:41,868 --> 00:20:43,161
It's my uncle's motel.

202
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,037
Just leave me alone, would you?

203
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,460
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

204
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:54,922
Please go.

205
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:57,592
Rebecca: You can't stay here.

206
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,510
Let me take you back to your place.

207
00:20:59,594 --> 00:21:01,721
No, I can't live there anymore.

208
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:07,393
- There's ghosts.
- Hmm.

209
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:11,481
Even before you wrecked it,
this dump is nowhere to live.

210
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,942
Come on. Let's go for a ride.

211
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,411
Rebecca: It's an old hunting cabin.

212
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:29,916
Hasn't been used in years,
but the water still runs.

213
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:32,627
Lucas: Whose is it?

214
00:21:34,212 --> 00:21:35,338
Rebecca: Who do you think?

215
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:39,759
Lucas: You really think
your uncle's gonna let me stay here?

216
00:21:41,052 --> 00:21:42,303
He won't know.

217
00:21:46,766 --> 00:21:48,142
How do you like it?

218
00:21:52,396 --> 00:21:53,606
Yeah.

219
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:55,358
Rebecca: I thought you would.

220
00:21:57,401 --> 00:21:58,903
No ghosts.

221
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:01,817
- Does this hurt?
- Not anymore.

222
00:24:05,112 --> 00:24:06,572
I hate that they did this to you.

223
00:24:08,157 --> 00:24:11,744
I had been meaning to get
that tattoo removed anyway.

224
00:24:14,205 --> 00:24:15,956
Just wish it could always be like this.

225
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:19,210
Maybe one day.

226
00:24:22,797 --> 00:24:24,090
You okay?

227
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,486
Hang on right there.
He'll be with you in a moment.

228
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:52,618
You fuck.

229
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,710
We have a strict agreement
with the redbones.

230
00:25:00,793 --> 00:25:05,798
You keep your business on the reservation,
and we keep ours off it.

231
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:09,468
You are in breach of that agreement.

232
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:27,528
Yeah?

233
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,952
I just got to work, for fuck's sake.

234
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:36,871
Who's there?

235
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:40,624
Shit.

236
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:46,130
No. Okay. Don't do a fucking thing.
I'm coming back to town.

237
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:48,466
Man: Well, you can ask him yourself.

238
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:51,177
Things are going fantastic over here.

239
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,512
This time you're buying. Okay.

240
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:55,656
All right, all right, all right. Great.

241
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,224
Say hi to Carol for me.

242
00:25:59,602 --> 00:26:02,271
Hey there, Calvin. What can I do you for?

243
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,357
I'm not feeling great.
I'm gonna need to go home.

244
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,902
- You look fine.
- I've got a stomach bug.

245
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,088
I thought I could make it
through the day, but I can't.

246
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:11,992
You're handling the tri-quarterlies,
aren't you?

247
00:26:12,531 --> 00:26:13,574
Mmm-hmm.

248
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:14,700
They done?

249
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:17,870
Not yet, no.

250
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,206
Kind of need those done today.

251
00:26:21,624 --> 00:26:22,809
Well, I can take them home with me

252
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:24,770
and I'll have them done for you
first thing tomorrow.

253
00:26:24,794 --> 00:26:27,546
We were late with them last quarter,
too, weren't we?

254
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:31,258
I don't think so, no.

255
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,135
I think we were, Calvin.

256
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,070
Gook motherfucker!

257
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:06,877
I'll have those to you
first thing tomorrow.

258
00:27:30,192 --> 00:27:31,432
What the fuck is he doing here?

259
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:34,905
We came in and found him here
with this motherfucker already in the vice.

260
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:37,283
He was dealing in our territory.

261
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,496
The territory you and your men
are charged with protecting.

262
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:45,374
I brought him here as

263
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:47,543
a courtesy.

264
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:49,003
Mmm-hmm.

265
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:53,186
So my tax dollars aren't enough
for you and your little tribe, huh?

266
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:56,135
Now you fuckers are going to encroach
on my business?

267
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:58,095
Fuck you.

268
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:01,557
I don't think so.

269
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,561
We pay for your houses...

270
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,438
For your damn reservations,

271
00:28:08,606 --> 00:28:11,233
for your school and your health care,

272
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:14,528
even when all of you were getting rich
off your fucking casinos, right?

273
00:28:15,404 --> 00:28:17,489
This country has lost its spine.

274
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,468
The politicians are giving it away
to the mutts and the mongrels

275
00:28:20,492 --> 00:28:23,871
while good, pure-blooded Americans
go hungry.

276
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:27,750
This isn't a nation anymore.
It's a fucking soup kitchen!

277
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:29,992
And you know what?

278
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,213
We're all out of fucking soup!

279
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:46,644
Thanks for the heads up.

280
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,580
You can tell proctor
that we've got it under control.

281
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:52,399
Don't use his name in front of outsiders.

282
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:53,692
Him?

283
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,070
Yeah, I don't think
he's paying too much attention.

284
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:19,385
You don't want me to come back here.

285
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,746
Hey, sugar.

286
00:29:55,004 --> 00:29:57,464
You disappear for a year and a half,

287
00:29:58,465 --> 00:30:00,592
you show up here looking like

288
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:03,053
something out of the Bible,

289
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:05,973
and all you got to say for yourself is

290
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:08,100
"hey, sugar"?

291
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:14,440
How you been?

292
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:17,860
Small talk?

293
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,695
Seriously?

294
00:30:23,699 --> 00:30:25,325
Somebody killed Rebecca bowman.

295
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:34,001
I know that.

296
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:38,672
Everybody around here knows that.

297
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:41,550
Now why do you know that?

298
00:30:44,136 --> 00:30:45,387
Well,

299
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,140
I guess I'm a suspect.

300
00:30:50,225 --> 00:30:51,518
Did you do it?

301
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:58,650
Look, it's a fair question.

302
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,320
I mean, look at yourself.

303
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:04,656
Where the hell have you been?

304
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,117
I had to disappear for a while.

305
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,286
Clear my head.

306
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,997
You clear your head for a few days.

307
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,999
A week maybe.

308
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:16,919
For you, maybe even a month.

309
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:20,005
But you, you went awol.

310
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:22,508
And you forgot about your friends
and you forgot about...

311
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,093
I did not forget about job.

312
00:31:25,344 --> 00:31:27,679
How the fuck was hiding away
gonna help him?

313
00:31:39,817 --> 00:31:41,276
You here for your money?

314
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,241
But I do need a car.

315
00:31:58,252 --> 00:31:59,545
Sugar: Only thing I bought.

316
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:04,466
Figured it might come in handy
if I ever needed a quick exit.

317
00:32:09,221 --> 00:32:10,472
So, what happens now?

318
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:12,474
I don't know.

319
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,686
But something, right?

320
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,565
Yeah. Something.

321
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:25,404
Remember, hood,
you're not the sheriff anymore.

322
00:32:27,906 --> 00:32:29,116
I never was.

323
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,163
Sugar: You know what I mean!

324
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:56,351
What'd the other guy look like?

325
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:57,436
Ha-ha.

326
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,771
Very fucking funny.

327
00:33:01,607 --> 00:33:03,400
Actually, I wasn't kidding.

328
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,158
What did he look like?

329
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:15,829
He looked like a fucking asshole
smashing the shit out of my hands.

330
00:33:17,331 --> 00:33:20,209
The guy stuck around long enough
to walk all over your face,

331
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:21,543
and you didn't even get a look?

332
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:23,003
It was dark.

333
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:25,797
Nina: Don't worry.

334
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,008
I got time.

335
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,932
You're back.

336
00:34:26,525 --> 00:34:28,026
Sorry about Rebecca.

337
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:32,429
What does this have to do with you?

338
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:34,741
Nothing.

339
00:34:35,534 --> 00:34:38,287
And yet here you are.
Is there anything I should know?

340
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,831
Lucas: Your uncle,

341
00:34:41,206 --> 00:34:42,291
he's not a good man.

342
00:34:42,374 --> 00:34:43,792
Well, then, let me live with you.

343
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:45,377
I'm not a good man either.

344
00:34:45,836 --> 00:34:47,963
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

345
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,882
You think I had anything to do
with my niece's death?

346
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:53,677
You may not have killed her,
but you sure as shit got her killed.

347
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:57,264
As soon as you took her in,
it was only a matter of time.

348
00:34:58,598 --> 00:34:59,725
Yeah.

349
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,643
You may be right.

350
00:35:03,812 --> 00:35:05,981
I'm gonna find that son of a bitch.

351
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,276
But as a mayor,

352
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:13,655
I'm somewhat hampered
in my ability to clarify matters.

353
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:18,076
How'd you pull that off?

354
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:19,619
I ran unopposed.

355
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:21,455
Of course.

356
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:30,422
Where would you start?

357
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:32,883
With the foothills. The boedickers.

358
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:36,970
- I heard they got burned down.
- It's true.

359
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,848
But Aaron boedicker's still alive.

360
00:35:41,433 --> 00:35:44,353
You guys, you did see
the yellow tape here, right?

361
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:45,562
Shenfi.

362
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:47,147
It's fine.

363
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:49,733
Our work is done here.

364
00:35:51,526 --> 00:35:52,694
Following me, Brock?

365
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:53,820
Me? No.

366
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:55,856
That's what deputies are for.

367
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:58,033
Is hood a suspect?

368
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:01,995
Well, if he was, you'd be the first
to know it, wouldn't you?

369
00:36:02,412 --> 00:36:06,500
No, Mr. Hood is a person of interest
in this case,

370
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:08,263
which is something you two have in common.

371
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:14,633
- Be careful, sheriff.
- I always am, Mr. Mayor.

372
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,183
Just like old times, huh?

373
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:25,435
Except no one's bleeding.

374
00:36:27,229 --> 00:36:28,313
Yet.

375
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:41,159
Hey, Kurt.

376
00:36:48,959 --> 00:36:51,211
Come on, bro.
How long are you gonna keep this up, man?

377
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,259
I saved your fucking life, Kurt.

378
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:59,737
What do you think watts would have done?
He would've had you executed.

379
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,848
I took action before he
could order it, that's it.

380
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,642
I was in the burn unit for two months.

381
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,602
I know and I'm sorry,

382
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:11,565
but you put me in an impossible situation
and I had to prove my loyalty to the cause.

383
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:12,983
You know that.

384
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:16,236
Just come for dinner, man.

385
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:18,363
Maggie would really love to see you.

386
00:37:18,447 --> 00:37:20,282
And we can work this out.

387
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:22,605
Brothers before brotherhood,
that's what you always said.

388
00:37:26,037 --> 00:37:27,497
You're not my brother.

389
00:37:28,206 --> 00:37:31,042
What? What the fuck did you just say to me?

390
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:35,380
I'm the only thing standing
between them and you, asshole.

391
00:37:36,548 --> 00:37:38,467
You better fucking remember that!

392
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:18,256
- Hey, Carrie.
- Hey, Brock.

393
00:38:20,217 --> 00:38:22,017
The place is really
starting to come together.

394
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:24,721
- Thanks.
- No.

395
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,556
Looks good.

396
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,102
How are the kids doing?

397
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,773
Oh, you know. Gordon's parents
are driving them crazy.

398
00:38:36,525 --> 00:38:38,276
Something on your mind, Brock?

399
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:45,200
Listen, Carrie, I don't
know if you've heard,

400
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,160
but hood is back.

401
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:52,999
Guess you haven't heard.

402
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:56,586
He's been living up in
the foothills in a cabin.

403
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:59,673
He, uh... he looks rough.

404
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:05,082
Just thought you'd want to know.

405
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:09,474
Yeah.

406
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,200
Call me if you need anything, all right?

407
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:13,979
Carrie: Okay.

408
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:18,441
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

409
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:44,175
Lewis, is everything okay?

410
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,886
Lewis, come in.

411
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:57,022
Man: Don't fucking move.

412
00:40:01,276 --> 00:40:02,485
Something funny?

413
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:04,738
Wait for it.

414
00:40:40,398 --> 00:40:41,399
Lucas: Uh-uh.

415
00:40:42,859 --> 00:40:44,069
Drop it!

416
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,118
You.

417
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,414
Long time, huh?

418
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,586
Why don't you take a seat?

419
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,215
You finally tracked me down
after all these years.

420
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,218
Lucas: Who are you?

421
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,261
My name is Dalton.

422
00:41:11,304 --> 00:41:12,514
Are you military?

423
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:14,057
I was.

424
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:20,146
But now I recruit men like you.
I develop them for an elite unit.

425
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,525
What unit?

426
00:41:24,776 --> 00:41:25,860
What branch?

427
00:41:27,153 --> 00:41:28,196
Exactly.

428
00:41:34,369 --> 00:41:36,371
- This is revenge?
- Revenge?

429
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:40,041
Not really.

430
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,466
Where's job?

431
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:50,343
How the fuck would I know?

432
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:53,471
No, no, no, no. You know how this works.
You taught me.

433
00:41:54,347 --> 00:41:58,393
Elbows, insteps, knees.
I can keep you alive for fucking days.

434
00:41:58,476 --> 00:42:01,563
I know, which is why if! Knew something,
I would tell you.

435
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:02,689
Bullshit.

436
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:04,816
I didn't take him.

437
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:07,235
But the man who did knew I would want him.

438
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:10,363
I paid him his price
and he handed over job.

439
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:12,741
Then what?

440
00:42:12,824 --> 00:42:14,159
I turned him in.

441
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,880
I cleaned my slate with the powers that be.

442
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:18,288
- And who are they?
- Oh, come on.

443
00:42:18,371 --> 00:42:21,499
Don't be a fucking idiot.
You know how this works.

444
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:23,835
Faces without names, names without faces.

445
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:26,421
Yeah, go ahead.
Go ahead, shoot my other knee.

446
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:29,382
Go ahead. You know that
it won't change what I'm saying.

447
00:42:29,799 --> 00:42:31,426
I have no idea where they took him.

448
00:42:31,509 --> 00:42:32,927
No, but you can find him.

449
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:36,890
Black sites, ghost detention centers.
You have access to those files.

450
00:42:36,973 --> 00:42:39,100
Not anymore.
After the congressional hearings,

451
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:42,187
they closed the loop and I'm not in it.

452
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,813
Bullshit. You are the fucking loop.

453
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:48,193
I was. That was 20
years ago. Things change.

454
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:50,904
Why are we even having this conversation?

455
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:54,491
You know that job is already dead.

456
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:57,535
No, he has intelligence.
He's a valuable asset.

457
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:00,622
His intelligence was 20 years old.

458
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:03,374
He was a fucking trophy grab.

459
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,711
- He was a head on somebody's wall.
- Whose wall?

460
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,297
Dalton: Doesn't matter.

461
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:12,133
The man's dead.

462
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:15,428
You know it and I know it.

463
00:43:18,932 --> 00:43:21,059
We got to go. We got to go now!

464
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,940
I guess I'm still in certain loops.

465
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,848
Lucas: Go, go, go!

466
00:44:30,169 --> 00:44:31,889
Did he come to see you?

467
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:35,133
Yes.

468
00:44:36,551 --> 00:44:39,470
But he's not the man that left that night.

469
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:40,763
Not anymore.

470
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,725
- Well, did he say where he's been?
- No.

471
00:44:44,976 --> 00:44:46,019
Did he say anything?

472
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:50,940
You thought he might have a lead on job?

473
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,778
Look, the day he left,

474
00:44:56,321 --> 00:45:00,783
that was the day you needed to stop
looking to him for any answers.

475
00:45:05,955 --> 00:45:07,123
You think job's still alive?

476
00:45:11,586 --> 00:45:12,754
I don't know.

477
00:45:13,671 --> 00:45:15,506
Sometimes I hope he isn't.

478
00:45:17,884 --> 00:45:21,763
Because if he is,
it makes us even bigger assholes

479
00:45:21,846 --> 00:45:23,014
than we already are.

480
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,990
So, you got nothing.

481
00:45:41,908 --> 00:45:43,159
Nothing.

482
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,662
Either he didn't know or he wouldn't say.

483
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:48,831
He didn't know.

484
00:45:48,915 --> 00:45:50,875
I guess we'll never know now.

485
00:45:51,876 --> 00:45:53,145
Did you really have to kill him?

486
00:45:53,169 --> 00:45:54,587
He didn't know.

487
00:45:55,171 --> 00:45:56,422
Okay.

488
00:45:57,423 --> 00:45:58,967
What's our next play?

489
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,551
We don't have one.

490
00:46:06,015 --> 00:46:07,225
It's over.

491
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:08,601
Sugar: No.

492
00:46:09,352 --> 00:46:11,521
We don't just give up.

493
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:13,064
We have no choice.

494
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,400
So, what?

495
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,488
- You're done?
- We got nothing.

496
00:46:21,072 --> 00:46:23,825
- So we find something.
- We've got nothing.

497
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,753
- I can't just leave him for dead.
- Do you think I want to?

498
00:46:40,758 --> 00:46:42,552
Don't you think I'd do anything?

499
00:46:49,684 --> 00:46:51,227
Dalton was right.

500
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:55,106
He was right.

501
00:46:55,398 --> 00:46:57,278
Job was dead from the moment
he handed him over.

502
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:03,823
Where the hell are you going?

503
00:47:03,906 --> 00:47:05,116
Lucas: He's dead.

504
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:29,182
Anybody home?

505
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:37,982
Hello?

506
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:42,236
Daddy!

507
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,405
What's up, little man?

508
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:45,865
- Where's your mommy?
- Upstairs.

509
00:47:45,948 --> 00:47:47,116
Yeah?

510
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,910
Babe, I'm home!

511
00:47:48,993 --> 00:47:50,703
Maggie: Coming.

512
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:53,289
God, you got bigger.
What do you weigh, like 1,000 pounds?

513
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:55,012
- No.
- What, are you, like, 10 feet tall?

514
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:57,168
- No.
- Okay, maybe tomorrow.

515
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:01,964
You're home early.

516
00:48:04,342 --> 00:48:06,382
Calvin: Yeah, we finished
the tri-quarterlies today.

517
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:08,763
The slope gave everybody the day off.

518
00:48:08,846 --> 00:48:10,181
Nice.

519
00:48:11,557 --> 00:48:13,059
It smells really good in here.

520
00:48:13,142 --> 00:48:15,770
It's just a pot roast and some soup.

521
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:16,854
Hmm.

522
00:48:17,939 --> 00:48:20,399
- You want to go shoot some hoops? Yeah?
- Yeah.

523
00:48:20,483 --> 00:48:23,123
Maybe we'll go play and mommy
will let us know when dinner's ready?

524
00:48:25,446 --> 00:48:27,049
Don't beat me like you did
last time, though, okay?

525
00:48:27,073 --> 00:48:29,051
- Will you take it easy on your old man?
- Hank: I will.

526
00:48:29,075 --> 00:48:31,195
Calvin: I'm pretty sure
I'm going to beat you, though.

527
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:36,934
Lucas: Where would you start?

528
00:49:37,602 --> 00:49:40,354
Kai: With the foothills. The boedickers.

529
00:49:42,398 --> 00:49:44,275
Lucas: I heard they got burned down.

530
00:49:44,942 --> 00:49:46,944
Kai: Aaron boedicker's still alive.

531
00:51:16,367 --> 00:51:18,077
Hey, boedicker.

532
00:51:19,954 --> 00:51:21,205
Remember me?

533
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,850
Where were you four nights ago?

534
00:51:41,684 --> 00:51:43,060
Fuck you.

535
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:48,649
I'm not gonna ask you again!

536
00:51:52,278 --> 00:51:54,780
I don't know what the fuck you want,

537
00:51:55,197 --> 00:51:56,991
but I'm not telling you shit.

538
00:51:57,742 --> 00:51:59,702
You took my fucking hand.

539
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:02,913
Rebecca bowman got killed four days ago.

540
00:52:03,497 --> 00:52:05,416
Fucking bitch had it coming.

541
00:52:06,334 --> 00:52:07,853
Yeah, see, when you say things like that,

542
00:52:07,877 --> 00:52:10,254
that makes me think
you had something to do with it.

543
00:52:14,216 --> 00:52:17,553
Oh, you can torture me all you want,
you fucking sadist,

544
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:20,181
but I'm only gonna tell you two things.

545
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:22,391
I didn't kill her,

546
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:26,437
and I don't give a shit she's dead.

547
00:52:30,941 --> 00:52:32,651
You do know something.

548
00:52:35,071 --> 00:52:36,447
Oh, I know a lot of things.

549
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:38,616
You know how a guy with no hands
wipes his ass?

550
00:52:47,666 --> 00:52:50,378
I've... I've got a nephew.

551
00:52:51,003 --> 00:52:52,046
Eljay.

552
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:55,091
Thinks he's some kind of rock star.

553
00:52:56,550 --> 00:52:58,886
He was fucking her for a while.

554
00:53:00,221 --> 00:53:01,722
Where do I find him?

555
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:04,433
I don't know where he stays,

556
00:53:04,517 --> 00:53:07,269
but he plays nights at this shithole
called snake eyes.

557
00:53:07,353 --> 00:53:08,521
It's off the connector.

558
00:53:12,858 --> 00:53:16,821
I find out you're lying to me,
I come back for the other hand.

559
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:36,882
You're not welcome around here.

560
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,510
I better get going, then.

561
00:53:41,345 --> 00:53:43,180
- You're not going anywhere.
- Want to bet?

562
00:53:49,728 --> 00:53:51,772
Looks like you're gonna
end up full of holes.

563
00:53:51,856 --> 00:53:54,024
Not before I put one
big fucking hole in you.

564
00:53:59,113 --> 00:54:01,198
- Okay, let's break it up!
- Man: God damn it.

565
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,451
Now.

566
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:06,078
Most cops know better
than to come into the hills.

567
00:54:08,414 --> 00:54:10,666
Most assholes know better
than to talk back to me.

568
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,687
Something makes me
think if I start looking,

569
00:54:13,711 --> 00:54:16,130
I'm gonna find a lot of
outstanding warrants standing here.

570
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:27,641
So, you are following me around.

571
00:54:27,725 --> 00:54:29,327
Yeah, I thought that was obvious
by the way I pulled up

572
00:54:29,351 --> 00:54:31,854
right at the Nick of time to save your ass.

573
00:54:34,231 --> 00:54:35,431
What are you doing here, hood?

574
00:54:36,233 --> 00:54:38,319
Just visiting an old friend.

575
00:54:38,402 --> 00:54:39,987
I'm guessing you're working an angle.

576
00:54:40,821 --> 00:54:43,115
That Rebecca was killed
by one of her uncle's enemies.

577
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:45,618
I'm not working any angles.

578
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,038
You're the sheriff now.
This is your fucking mess.

579
00:54:49,413 --> 00:54:52,666
Yeah, and you're still a person of interest
in this mess.

580
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,169
Does that mean you're gonna follow me
all fucking day?

581
00:54:55,252 --> 00:54:58,064
Yeah, well, believe it or not, hood,
I've got better things to do with my time.

582
00:54:58,088 --> 00:54:59,131
Good.

583
00:55:02,801 --> 00:55:04,845
And you're welcome, by the way!
